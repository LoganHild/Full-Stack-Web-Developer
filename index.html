            </div>
            <p>I am from Cannon Falls, Minnesota, a town of 4,000 or so people.
                I have a huge family. To the point I don't recognize them in public or know their names. 
                I've worked as a DSP for about 6 years taking care of vulnerable adults.
                My favorite hobby is just being at home and relaxing. I love Dogs, and I try to visit my family dog whenever I have a chance. His name is Teddy.
                Lately I have really enjoyed working with CSS and getting to see my changes in real time.
                I enjoy playing Video Games in my free time. Lately I have been focused on trying new recipes, trying to exercise more, 
                and just trying to live a healthier lifestyle in general. The keyword here is "trying." </p>
