        <h3 id="about">About Me</h3>
        <p id ="para1" class="titles">I am from Cannon Falls, Minnesota, a town of 4,000 or so people.
            I have a huge family. To the point I don't recognize them in public or know their names. 
            I've worked as a DSP for about 6 years taking care of vulnerable adults.
           My favorite hobby is just being at home and relaxing. 
           Lately I have really enjoyed working with CSS and getting to see my changes in real time.
