  ## Description
  Deployed portfolio to be updated with time for showcasing previous work samples, as well as demonstrate some of the skills acquired along the way. Also provides a few details about my background and plans for the future.

  ## Usage
  Links at the top are like a table of contents for the page, bringing the user to different parts of my portfolio. I have also included a link for downloading a pdf of my resume. When the user reaches the projects section, they can click the title of each to see the GitHub repo, or click on the screenshot to be redirected to the deployed application. Contact links are provided at the bottom of the page to send me an email, call my cell phone, see my GitHub profile, and visit my LinkedIn page.
